# Part Of Speech Tagging Using Hidden Markov Model

Implemented a bi-gram model for part of speech tagging using Hidden Markov Fields.

The following repository has an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm and the Hidden Markov Model.

Clone the repository and run `hmm.py` to evaluate the model. 

To understand the entire repository, you must check out the `Hidden_Markov_Model.ipynb`, in which the entire project was built. 

By running `hmm.py` you will understand the strength of the probabilistic model 'HMM'. A simple task like Part of Speech Tagging can easily be done by Hidden Markov Model. Viterbi Algorithm helps in effectively search for the best hidden sequence given an observed sequence. You might get a better overview after refering to the colab notebook.

Happy Coding!
